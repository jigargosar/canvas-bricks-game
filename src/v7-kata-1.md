# Notes

- shift+space key shortcut causes unecessary pauses @vsc
- have to type commit messages over and over again @vsc
- gclm ext has sample code to show quick pick. check api and see if we can use custom filter to narrow list.

# Resources

- git commit message prefilling & history.

  - notes: it prefills the commit msg input box, in git view. so pressing commit shortcut, directly commits instead of showing a quick input dialog
